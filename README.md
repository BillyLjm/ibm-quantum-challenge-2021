## Description  
The challenge consisted of 5 exercises, in each `ex*` folder.  
Each folder has the main `.ipynb` workbook, and a `.html` copy if you prefer.  
`ex5` also has a `.png` plots of the VQE convergence, and `.csv` data of comparing the different VQE parameters.  
  
## Topics  
[`ex1`](ex1/ex1.ipynb) - Gate Decomposition (CCNOT gate)  
[`ex2`](ex2/ex2.ipynb) - Algorithms (Shor's Factorisation)  
[`ex3`](ex3/ex3.ipynb) - Quantum Error Detection (Surface Code)  
[`ex4`](ex4/ex4.ipynb) - Qiskit Pulse (Qubit Spectroscopy)  
[`ex5`](ex5/ex5.ipynb) - Variational Quantum Eigensolver
